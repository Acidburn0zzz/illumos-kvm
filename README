BUILDING

Building the kvm driver is pretty easy and compared to building O/N it will
finish in a snap.

Preparation:

Edit the Makefile and appropriately set the path for the KERNEL_SOURCE
directory that points to the root of a checked out and built illumos directory.

Verify that gcc is installed and the version you'd like to use is in your path.
Note that this has only been tested against the SFW version of gcc -- version
3.4.

Verify that you either have SUNWmake or GNU make installed.

Building and Development:

To build, simply use the default make target:

$ make

To check style, header files, and other various nits:

$ make check


INSTALLING

There are two mandatory artifacts to install and one optional component:

kvm		The driver
kvm.so		The mdb module
kvm.conf	The driver configuration file

On the target machine:
Place kvm in /kernel/drv/amd64
Place kvm.conf in /kernel/drv
add_drv kvm
ln -s /devices/pseudo/kvm@0:kvm /dev/kvm

That's all there is too it. Good luck, make sure you have a dump device, and
don't panic!
